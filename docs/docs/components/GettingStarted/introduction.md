<p>We transfered the common ui that we use with our enterprize companies, plugins and erxes into common components.</p>

## Installation

<p>If you wish to use our common components in your project, we have npm package named "erxes-ui" which you can install with: </p>
<Examples type="install" />

## Work on erxes-ui

<p>First and foremost, If you're planning to work on erxes-ui and try it on your own project, you have to clone erxes-ui from the following repository on github. (It has to be cloned in the same folder with your project!)</p>
<Examples type="clone" />

<p>The changes wouldn't automatically run on your project after you made it. You have to delete the <code>lib</code> folder and add it again. In short:</p>
<Examples type="erxes-ui" />

<p>While you can still use require() and module.exports, we encourage you to use import and export instead.</p>
<p>Import paths are displayed in the API section of each component.</p>
