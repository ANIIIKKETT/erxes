## Server Installation

erxes gives you several guides and options for installing the erxes platform. But in this guide we chose ubuntu 20.04 to install Erxes but you can choose from any linux based distro like RHEL, Centos etc by adapting certain commands work on certain OS.

- The first guide is the [Quick Start](ubuntu-quickstart.mdx) installation guide where we provide a script that automates most of the installation process. 
- The second guide is a comprehensive, [Step by Step](ubuntu-step-by-step.mdx) installation guide where developers can see exactly what is being installed and how. The **Step by Step** installation guide is also used where heavy resources are needed when using erxes. Additional components are installed during the **Step by Step** installation.
- The third guide is the [docker-compose](docker.md) using erxes images locate in dockerhub.

Most users will find the **Quick start** installation to be more than sufficient. You can always upgrade at any time.
